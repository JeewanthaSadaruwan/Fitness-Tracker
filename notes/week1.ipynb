    "\n",
    "## The quantified self\n",
    "The quantified self is any individual engaged in the self-tracking of any kind of biological, physical, behavioral, or environmental information. The self-tracking is driven by a certain goal of the individual, with a desire to act upon the collected information — Hoogendoorn, M., & Funk, B. (2018). Machine learning for the quantified self. On the art of learning from sensory data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project overview (what you will learn)\n",
    "- Part 1 — Introduction, goal, quantified self, MetaMotion sensor, dataset\n",
    "- Part 2 — Converting raw data, reading CSV files, splitting data, cleaning\n",
    "- Part 3 — Visualizing data, plotting time series data\n",
    "- Part 4 — Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor\n",
    "- Part 5 — Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering\n",

    "## Barbell Exercise Classification and Repetition Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the main goal is to categorize and detect repetitions for each exercise type. The exercise types considered are barbell exercises, specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bench Press\n",
    "- Barbell Row\n",
    "- Squat\n",
    "- Deadlift\n",
    "- Overhead Press\n",
    "\n",
    "For each workout session, the system will:\n",
    "- Detect which barbell exercise is being performed\n",
    "- Count the number of repetitions for each exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be achieved by processing sensor data, extracting features, building machine learning models, and developing custom algorithms for repetition counting."
